# waving-hand-robot
The SSE Waving Hand Bot, 10 years in the making lol

## What's Needed to Run this
- An Arduino UNO
- A 2 phase stepper motor
  - And driver!!
- An ultrasonic sensor
- 10 years of patience

## How it works

The current design for the project is to have a stepper motor that periodically waves in response to some stimuli. We intend for it to be activated by the waving of a hand in front of our ultrasonic sensor.

## Our Developers

### Nat Manoucheri
Responsible for wiring the Motor and Driver to the Arduino

### Tristen Kurutz
Responsible for wiring the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino, and the program logic that calculates the distance from the sensor to an object.
